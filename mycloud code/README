The current organization of the project has the client and server in individual folders.
Each has a copy of all the files needed for compilation.
Each has a makefile.

Some things worth mentioning:
	If the client sends an invalid key, the server closes the connection.
	If the server exits abruptly (SIGINT, for example), sometimes it takes a few minutes for the kernel to free the port for use again. During this time, the server will be unable to listen to the same port.
	Filename are no more than 80 bytes... 79 characters and the null terminator
	I did NOT use the code provided by the book; I did use it as a reference though.
	Requests and responses are modeled using structs. All types of requests and responses fit into the respective struct.
		mycloud_request and mycloud_response (defined in mycloud.h)
